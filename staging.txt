<h4 style="text-align: justify;">1.1 <u>Introduction platform</u></h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     TheFork Site is a platform that allows the User to connect with the     restaurants listed on TheFork Site, among other functionnalities. As such,     TheFork acts exclusively as an intermediary in connection with the     reservation of said restaurants by the User.</p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;"> 1.2 <u>Real time search for and reservation of tables in a restaurant </u></h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     TheFork Site allows the User to search for and reserve a table in a     restaurant in real time. </p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">     1.3 <u> Promotional offers from restaurants listed on TheFork Site</u></h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     TheFork Site allows the User, provided that the reservation is made through     TheFork Site, to benefit from promotional offers provided by the     restaurants on TheFork Site.

<p style="text-align: justify;">     One condition of validity is that the User and their entire party must     arrive at the restaurant reserved at the time reserved. If a User and all     their guests do not show up at the restaurant within 15 minutes of the     reserved time, the restaurant may choose to not apply the promotional offer     associated with the reservation for the User and their party. For the sake     of clarity, this means that if the User or any of their guests is more than     15 minutes late, the User and their entire party will lose the automatic     benefit of the promotional offer and the restaurant may decide whether or     not to apply the promotional offer to all or some of the guests. </p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">     5.1 <u>Conditions for posting reviews</u></h5>

<ul type="disc">

  <li style="text-align: justify;">         To avoid any conflict of interest and for obvious reasons of         objectivity, if any User works in the restaurant sector, they are not         permitted to post a review on TheFork Site.     </li>

  <li style="text-align: justify;">         The review must contain more than 200 characters and relate exclusively         to the restaurant visited. Any review mentioning another restaurant may         be rejected by TheFork.     </li>
</ul>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">     5.2 <u>Reasons for rejecting User Content</u></h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     User Content may be rejected for the following reasons: </p>

<ul type="disc">
  <li style="text-align: justify;">         if the User does not adhere to the "Conditions for posting reviews" as         set out above;     </li>

  <li style="text-align: justify;">         if TheFork believes that its civil or criminal liability may be         engaged;     </li>

  <li style="text-align: justify;">         if the User Content or the elements relating to the identity of the         author contain insults or vulgarities;     </li>

  <li style="text-align: justify;">         if the text of the User Content contains random characters or word         sequences with no meaning;     </li>

  <li style="text-align: justify;">         if the User Content is unrelated to the restaurant being reviewed;     </li>

  <li style="text-align: justify;">         if the User Content is or is suspected of being a breach of third         parties’ intellectual property rights;     </li>

  <li style="text-align: justify;">         if the review raises issues of conflict of interest or fraud, or if TheFork believes that it does amount to such conflict or fraud;     </li>

  <li style="text-align: justify;">         if the text of the User Content is badly written to the point of being         unintelligible;     </li>

  <li style="text-align: justify;">         if a User makes an inappropriate comment about another item of User         Content or its author;     </li>

  <li style="text-align: justify;">         if the User Content contains personal information or elements likely to         lead to identity theft, such as the first or last names of individuals         who are not public persons, a telephone number, a postal address or an         email address;     </li>

  <li style="text-align: justify;">         if the User Content mentions websites, hypertext links, URLs, email         addresses or telephone numbers; or     </li>

  <li style="text-align: justify;">         if the User Content is clearly spam.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     If a User is identified as having posted content which is fraudulent or     that TheFork believes to be fraudulent, TheFork, after applying     the procedures for the rejection or deletion of the review, may deactivate     the User's account (which will cancel all their current reservations and     annul any accumulated Yums), and delete all of their posts. </p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">     5.3 <u>Moderation of reviews</u></h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     TheFork has no obligation to moderate or remove reviews.

<p style="text-align: justify;">     Any User who has published a review may later request its deletion by     writing to <a href="mailto:contact@thefork.com">contact@thefork.com</a>.     When TheFork becomes aware that a restaurant has closed or changed     ownership reviews posted prior to that event will be deleted. Users may be     contacted by TheFork to check the authenticity of their review by     email and/or by telephone.

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">     7.5 <u>Penalties</u></h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     Users acknowledge and understand that failure to comply with the provisions     of this Article 7 constitutes an infringement punishable by civil and     criminal law. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br>
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>8. <u>Limitations of liability</u></strong></h4>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">8.1 <u>Warning</u></h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     It is up to Users to make any checks that seem necessary or opportune     before making a reservation in one of the restaurants listed on TheFork     Site. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     TheFork offers no warranty whatsoever in relation with the     Restaurateur Content or the services and/or commercial practices of the     third parties listed on TheFork Site. Accordingly, TheFork does not     warrant that Users will be satisfied with the products, services and/or     business practices experienced following a reservation made through TheFork     Site. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     TheFork offers no warranty in relation with the content, objectivity     or accuracy of the User Content, including but not limited to the reviews     posted by Users on TheFork Site. </p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">     8.2 <u>Modification of TheFork Site</u></h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     Given the interactivity of TheFork Site, all information it contains is     subject to change at any time, without this engaging the responsibility of TheFork. </p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">     8.3 <u>Use of TheFork Site</u></h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     Due to the specific nature of the Internet, TheFork does not warrant     uninterrupted access to TheFork Site or service continuity, the only     obligation of TheFork being one of reasonable endeavours in this     respect. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     TheFork shall not be liable for any failure to access TheFork Site or     for any damage or loss arising out of the use or inability to use TheFork     Site or its content, except as provided by law. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     TheFork does not warrant that the information displayed is detailed,     complete, verified or accurate. The Restaurateur Content, information,     restaurant pages and, in general, any content on TheFork Site are provided     "as is" without any express or implied warranties of any kind whatsoever. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     Users expressly acknowledges that the photos on TheFork Site are not     contractual. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     Users generally accept and acknowledge that the reservation with a     restaurant is not guaranteed. Accordingly, TheFork does not guarantee     the effectiveness of the reservation service. Availability is checked in     real time via computer. However, as TheFork cannot physically verify     the accuracy of the information collected and/or provided by the     restaurants, Users agree that TheFork cannot be held liable if Users     fail to benefit from the services of the restaurant. Indeed, the settings     of the real-time reservation software depend partly on the information     provided and/or recorded by the restaurant and may not correspond to     reality. Thus, for example and without limitation, Users acknowledge and     accept that TheFork is in no way liable if areservation is cancelled,     the establishment is closed (for whatever reason), or where any third party     refuses to provide any service, for any reason whatsoever. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     Similarly, Users accept that TheFork is in no way liable if Users     fail to benefit from promotions or special offers proposed by a restaurant.     Users acknowledge and accept that TheFork is in no way liable in the     event that ta restaurant does not honour a promotion or a special offer for     any reason whatsoever. </p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">     8.4 <u>Users warranties and indemnities</u></h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     Users warrant that they are fully familiar with the features and     limitations of the internet. In particular, they acknowledge that it is     impossible to guarantee that the data sent by Users over the internet will     be fully secure. TheFork cannot be held responsible for any incidents     which could arise from this transmission of data. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     Users agrees to indemnify TheFork against any liability, damage,     expense, claim or cost, incurred by TheFork arising from any claim or     dispute, in or out of court, in relation with the use of the services of TheFork, including the posting of User Content on TheFork Site by Users. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     In any case, Users explicitly acknowledge and agree to use TheFork Site at     their own risk and under their sole responsibility. </p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">     8.5 <u>Notification and removal of illegal content</u></h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     Any Users may give notice of a claim or objection relating to illicit     elements or content posted on TheFork Site. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     If a User believes elements or content posted on TheFork Site is illegal     and/or in breach of their copyright, they must notify TheFork by     registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt addressed to the "Legal Department" or by email to    <a href="mailto:contact@thefork.com">contact@thefork.com</a> stating "For     the attention of the Legal Department" in the subject line and including     all available evidence to support ownership of the rights, if any. Once     this procedure has been followed, and after the accuracy of the notice has     been checked, TheFork shall endeavour to promptly remove the illicit     content. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     TheFork acts as an intermediary in the provision of its services to     Users. Consequently and in accordance with Article 6 I.3 of French Law on     Confidence in the Digital Economy (LCEN) of 21 June 2004 (as amended), TheFork cannot be held criminally liable for the information stored on     TheFork Site if it did not have actual knowledge of the illegal activity or     information (including User Content, Restaurateur Content, etc.) or if, as     soon as it became aware, prompt action was taken to remove such information     or block access to it.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     Except as may be otherwise provided in these Terms of Use, the failure or     delay by TheFork in exercising any of its rights or remedy under the     terms these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of the right or     remedy or prevent any further exercising of the right or remedy. On the     contrary, such right or remedy shall remain in full force and effect. </p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">     9.3 <u>Applicable law</u></h5>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PART 2. LOYALTY PROGRAM - SPECIAL CONDITIONS</strong></h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     These Loyalty Program – Special Conditions complement Part 1: General     Conditions of Use. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions     of this Part 2, Loyalty Program – Special Conditions and those of Part 1,     General Conditions of Use, the provisions of this Part 2, Loyalty Program –     Special Conditions shall prevail. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br>
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. <u>Description of the Loyalty Program</u></strong></h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     The loyalty program allows Users to accumulate loyalty points ("Yums")     after a reservation on TheFork Site that is duly honoured (the "Loyalty     Program"). </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br>
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. <u>Participation in the Loyalty Program</u></strong></h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     Any User who holds an account on TheFork Site is eligible for the Loyalty     Program. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     Participation in the Loyalty Program is free and automatic. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br>
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. <u>Earning Yums</u></strong></h4>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">3.1 <u>General conditions for earning Yums</u></h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     The Loyalty Program allows Users to accumulate loyalty points after a reservation on TheFork Site that is duly honoured, regardless of the     restaurant reserved on TheFork Site and whether the reservation was made     with or without promotional offer. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When a reservation is made on TheFork Site and duly honoured, Users obtain a     pre-defined number of Yums (which may vary, depending in particular on the     method of reservation: website, mobile or application) seven days after the     date of the meal, regardless of the number of guest associated with the     reservation and regardless of the country where the reservation was made. </p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">In the event that the reservation is made with a Loyalty Discount (as defined in article 4.1 below) or cancelled by the User or if the User does not go to the restaurant and honour the reservation (no-show), the User does not earn Yums.</span></p>

<p>The amount of Yums earned by each User is stored and can be accessed in the "My Loyalty" section <a href="https://www.thefork.com/#user-account" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">of the User account</a>.<span lang="EN-GB"></span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">     3.2 <u>Special conditions for earning Yums</u></h5>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">     3.2.1 <u>Special promotions with promotion code</u></h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     From time to time TheFork puts in place special promotions for a     limited period during which Users may gain more Yums than usual (the     "Special Promotion"). </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     During each Special Promotion, Users receive an email specifying the     conditions for earning extra Yums. One of these conditions is the     obligation to enter a promotion when Users make their next reservation on     TheFork Site (the "Promo Code"). </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The amount of Yums obtained through the Special Promotion is stored and can be accessed in the "My Loyalty" section <a href="https://www.thefork.com/#user-account" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">of the User account</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     When issued, the Promo Code has a validity period limited to the duration     of the Special Promotion. The Promo Code has no monetary value and cannot     be loaned, transferred or sold to anyone or used for any purpose other than     those defined by TheFork in these Loyalty Program – Special     Conditions. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br>
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4. <u>Using Yums</u></strong></h4>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">     4.1 <u>Loyalty Discount conversion</u></h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     Once obtained and after reservation on TheFork Site, Yums can be converted     into a price discount deducted from the bill of a restaurant who is     enrolled in the Loyalty Program (the "Loyalty Discount"). </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The chart for Yums conversion into a Loyalty Discount can be accessed in the "My Loyalty" section <a href="https://www.thefork.com/#user-account" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">of the User account</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The list of Loyalty Program partner restaurants is available in the loyalty     space of the User account on TheFork Site. Partner restaurants are also     identified anywhere on TheFork Site with a specific mention.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     To convert Yums into Loyalty Discount, Users must select a     Loyalty Program partner restaurant, choose the Loyalty Discount option and a time slot where Loyalty Discount are accepted before validating their reservation. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     That Loyalty Program partner restaurant is then responsible for     automatically and without further formalities deducting the Loyalty     Discount from the bill. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     If the amount of the Loyalty Discount is greater than the amount of the     bill, the deduction made by the restaurant may not exceed the amount of the     bill. In other words, the restaurant cannot pay the User the difference     between the amount of the Loyalty Discount and the amount of the bill. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     In the event that there is a promotional offer that can be combined with a Loyalty Discount, the restaurant will apply the promotional offer before the     deduction of the Loyalty Discount. </p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Yums earned by Users can be converted into Loyalty Discount during their validity period as displayed in the Loyalty Program presentation page of TheFork Website. Yums’ expiration date can be viewed in the “<a href="https://www.thefork.com/#user-account" rel="nofollow">My Loyalty</a>” section of the User’s account.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     The Yums are strictly personal, have no monetary value and cannot be     loaned, transferred, or sold to anyone or used for any purpose other than     those defined by TheFork in these Loyalty Program – Special     Conditions. </p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">     4.2 <u>Cancellation / no-show</u></h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     If a User has reserved with a Loyalty Discount and cancels the reservation,     or if the restaurant cancels the reservation, the Yums converted to Loyalty     Discount at the time of reservation will be re-credited to the User's     account and may be used for a new reservation. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     If a User does not go to the restaurant (no-show), the Loyalty Discount and     the Yums thus converted are lost and will not be re-credited to the User's     account. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br>
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5. <u>Deletion of Yums</u></strong></h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">TheFork reserves the right to withhold or delete Yums obtained     through the use of Promo Codes or Sponsorship Codes by any User where TheFork reasonably determines or believes that the use or redemption of     the Promo Code or Sponsorship Code was fraudulent, illegal, made in error     or in violation of the applicable Special promotion conditions or these     Loyalty Program –Special Conditions.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     Furthermore, failure by Users to comply with these Terms of Use (including     failure to honour several reservations (no-shows)), any abuse or fraudulent     use of TheFork Site and/or Yums, or any behaviour prejudicial to the     interests of TheFork may result in the deactivation of the User's     account and/or the immediate deletion of all or part of the Yums stored in     the loyalty space of the User's account on TheFork Site, without prior     notice or compensation. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br>
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6. <u>Modification/Suspension/closure of the Loyalty Program</u></strong></h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     TheFork reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the     Loyalty Program at any time without incurring any liability whatsoever. In     this case, TheFork will inform Users by email and/or posting on     TheFork Site indicating the new terms and conditions of the Loyalty Program     and/or the terms of the closure of the Loyalty Program. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br>
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>7. <u>Limitation of Responsibility</u></strong></h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     With respect to the Loyalty Program, TheFork is only oblige to use     reasonable endeavours and accept liability only in relation to the     attribution of Yums to the Users. Consequently, TheFork cannot be     held liable for any claims relating to Yums after they have been duly     attributed to a User by TheFork. More specifically, TheFork has     no liability once Yums have been converted into a Loyalty Discount by a     User. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     As such, TheFork is not responsible for any failure by the restaurant     to apply the Loyalty Discount to the User. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">     In any event, TheFork declines any responsibility in connection to     the Loyalty Program in the event of contractual breach and/or fault of the     User.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;" id="reviews-and-ratings-notice">D. REVIEWS AND RATINGS NOTICE</h1>

<p>Published September 7th, 2022</p>

<h3><strong>1. Calculation of the restaurant rating</strong></h3>

<p>When Users rate a restaurant, we ask them to evaluate 3 criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The quality of the meal, which corresponds to 50% of the rating</li>

  <li>The service, which corresponds to 25% of the rating</li>

  <li>The ambience of the restaurant, which corresponds to 25% of the rating</li>
</ul>

<p>The calculation of the restaurant rating on the TheFork platform is an average of all User ratings from the past year. TheFork relies on the arithmetic method (Bayesian method in the Netherlands) to calculate the average rating of any partner restaurant.</p>

<p>Users can also rate the quality-price ratio, the level of noise, the waiting time, and the quality of food. These extra criteria do not impact the rating, but they can help improve the restaurant’s service by giving the restaurant feedback on these points.</p>

<p>Finally, Users can also leave a review to back up their rating; briefly explaining how their experience at the restaurant was, what their favorite dish was, the ambience, and the service.</p>

<p>Users' opinions are not only important to us, but also beneficial to all in TheFork’s community.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Management of reviews by Users</strong></h3>

<p>If Users made a reservation with TheFork and enjoyed a meal, they have up to 3 months from the date of the meal to share their dining experience. We suggest that Users leave a review as soon as possible to avoid forgetting details of their experience.</p>

<p>To leave a gastronomic experience review, Users have the following 3 options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using the link provided from TheFork in the email received after the meal, if the meal was honored</li>

  <li>By going through the User’s TheFork account in the app</li>

  <li>By scanning the TheFork QR code at the table in restaurants that offer this feature, and only after paying the bill with TheFork PAY</li>
</ul>

<p>These 3 options are the only avenues for Users to provide reviews, as this allows TheFork to verify that Users visited the restaurant they are leaving a review for.</p>

<p>We would like to emphasize the fact that our platform, and the reviews of any restaurants listed, consist of all reviews provided by Users. This means that all reviews, positive or not, are published for all users to consider (if they otherwise comply with our <a href="#TermsOfUse">Terms of use</a>, see our moderation process below). We believe all reviews about dining experiences have their place on our platform and are essential to the TheFork community.</p>

<h3><strong>3. Moderation of reviews by TheFork</strong></h3>

<p>To maintain a high level of reliability and transparency, all reviews submitted by Users and replies from restaurants will go through our moderation process.</p>

<p>Reviews are verified by both an automated moderation tool and our team of moderators if needed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We use a sophisticated automated moderation tool to identify reviews which may not be genuine or breach our rules on reviews as set out in our <a href="#TermsOfUse">Terms of use</a> (Article 6.1 Conditions for posting reviews and Article 6.2 Reasons for rejecting Users Content). Reviews which are not flagged as potentially inauthentic or breaching our rules will be published automatically.</li>

  <li>When our moderation tool notices a potential problem, our moderation team verifies the review and confirms if it is from a consumer who had a genuine experience eating at the restaurant in question and otherwise meets our <a href="#TermsOfUse">Terms of use</a>. This may include, for example, contacting Users by email or telephone to reconfirm information.</li>

  <li>When our moderation team confirms that the review does not comply with the requirements (e.g., when Users did not eat at the restaurant, they cannot leave a review about the gastronomic experience; if the booking is set as no show by the restaurant or if diners cancel the booking) we do not publish it and Users will not have the opportunity to reformulate their review.</li>

  <li>When the review does not comply with our other rules (e.g. when the whole review is incomprehensible, when the review is discriminatory, when there is a high inconsistency between the rating and the comment, etc.), we will inform the User and ask them to reformulate their review in a manner that complies with our <a href="#TermsOfUse">Terms of use</a>.</li>

  <li>If you suspect that a review is not genuine or does not comply with our rules, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@thefork.com">contact@thefork.com</a> specifying the reason for your concerns and our moderation team will investigate as described above. We respond to all requests for moderation, from both restaurants and Users equally.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a lot of reviews are submitted each day, there may be some delay in the publication:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>rating</strong> is published immediately (if the rating does not comply with the requirement above regarding honoring the booking, it is then deleted).</li>

  <li>The <strong>review</strong> can take up to 15 days to be published when it needs to be checked by our moderating team.</li>

  <li>The <strong>review</strong> will only be visible on the TheFork once the restaurant has 3 or more reviews. If the restaurant has less than 3 reviews, the first 3 reviews will be saved and published when the restaurant has reached the threshold.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>4. Right of reply of the restaurant</strong></h3>

<p>Once a review is published, restaurant owners have the right to <strong>reply within 3 months</strong> of the review being submitted. The response should not exceed the review length and, in any case, cannot exceed 1024 characters.</p>

<p>All restaurants’ replies undergo the same moderation process as described in point 3 above.</p>
